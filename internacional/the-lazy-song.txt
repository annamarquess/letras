Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

Boy, you know I'm crazy over you
I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
And uh, she got the hots for me
The finest thing my hood has seen
But oh no, oh no, she got a man and a son though
But that's okay, cause I
Wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
Like a shortstop, pick up e'rything mami hittin'
And in no time I plan to make this one here mine
And that's for sure, cause I
I never been the type to break up a happy home, but uh
There's something 'bout baby girl I just can't leave alone
So tell me, ma, what's it gonna be?

Boy, you know I'm crazy over you
I see a lot, and you look, and I never say a word
I know how start actin' trippin' out here about they girls
And there's no way, Nelly gon' fight over no dame
As you can see, but I
I like your steez, your style, your whole demeanor
The way you come through and holla
And swoop me in his two-seater
Now that's gangst, and I got special ways to thank ya
Don't you forget it, but uh
It ain't that easy for you to pack and leave him
But uh, you and dirty got ties for different reasons
I respect that, and right before I turn to leave
She said, she said
